## Using mathjax to include mathematical expressions (2):

Exercise 3.5.16

Show that, if function $$f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$$ defined on $$X\subset\mathbb{R}$$ is increasing and its image $$f(X)$$ is connected, $$f$$ is continuous.

$$Proof.$$

If f is not continuous, for some $$x_0\in\mathbb{R}$$, below holds:

$$\forall\delta\gt 0$$, $$\exists x\in X$$ and $$\epsilon\gt 0$$ such that


$$\left| x-x_{0}\right|$$ and

$$ \lt\delta $$

$$\left| f(x)-f(x_0)\right| \gt\epsilon$$


As $$f$$ is increasing, if we set $$U\eq X\cap\left(-\infty,x_0\right]$$ and $$V\eq X\cap\left[x_0+\delta,\infty\right)$$,

$$f(U)\cap f(V) = 

$$f(U)$$ and $$f(V)$$ becomes a separation in
