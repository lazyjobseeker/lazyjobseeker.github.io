## [TED Dictation 006] MY 105 DAYS IN TALIBAN PRISON - AND A CALL TO AID AFGHANISTAN

Kafi Rauf

Sep 02, 2022

It's 8:15 p.m in Afghanistan right now. And at this time 10 days ago, I was sitting in an 8 foot by 8 foot cell in the basement of a maximum security prison in Kabul where I was being held captive by the Taliban.
I'd been in that cell for 104 days and yet I was one of lucky ones. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me go back to the beginning.
This is me. I'm 5 years old and living in an Afghan refugee camp in `Peshawar`, Parkistan. You can see the two patches on my `UNHCR` donated jeans. One patch is an American flag and the other is the Statue of Liberty. The `quintessential` beacons of the American dream I so badly wanted.
But as a refugee I didn't have a state to call home, and not having the state I didn't have rights. And not having rights I didn't have a voice. I needed someone to advocate for me.
And I was fortunate to have two advocates. My parents who had `emigrated` to United States 4 years ahead of me, fought `tirelessly` to get me to America for those 4 years.
They gave me a voice, they gave me the American Dream. And my parent's advocacy allowed me to join them to `emmigrate` to Omaha, Nebrasca to go to high school in the states to serve in the military to graduate as a `Tillman Scholar` from Georgetown University and to get accepted into medical school. I became the American Dream.
And `in` my dream everything came `full` circle. This past summer I deferred one dream for another when I put medical school on hold, founded Human First `Coalition` an organization dedicated to aiding Afghans in need.
Having spent the first 17 years of my life stateless I rather abruptly found myself in the role of humanitarian aid worker who had shaped so much of my life.
I became that advocate and that voice for others. And becoming an aid worker I got to provide food, medical care, and shelter for thousands of Afghans. I got to operate resettlement flights for thousands more and I got to make multiple trips to Kabul, with the Taliban's blessing to `oversee` it all.
But then on December 18, 2021 everything changed. That morning, which started off like any other morning I was suddenly inexplicabily and unexpectedly taken into Taliban `custody`.
As I was being driven to Taliban's `General Directorate of Intelligence` headquaters I was told that I just needed to answer a few routine questions, and then I'd be sent back to my hotel. Instead, a few hours later I was brought into that basement room, three roommates, no blankets, no `mattress`, no pillow, no sun, no way to communicate with outside, and no clue what was to become of me.
And from that moment on I stayed in that basement in the dead of the Afghan winter for 105 days. The entire time I feared that I might be taken in front of a firing squad at any minute, and on 45th day I was beaten and tortured by 11 men `wielding` pipes after 8 days on hunger strike. I had done nothing wrong.
But again I was lucky. I not only had several exceptional advocates but I had a state. The US government gave me a voice and asserted my human rights and that voice ultimately led to my release 10 days ago.
And on the day of my release following a 4-hour flight from Kabul to Qatar the `euphoria` I felt as I walked off the plane is indescribable.
But admist the triumph and joy of homecoming something was `amiss`. On the day of my release I returned to society to find the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan was only getting worse, the whole world was fixated on Ukraine, and nearly every Afghan resettlement effort was on pause or had grounded to a `screeching` halt with no effective real solution in sight.
And that was huge `letdown`. And that is why I decided that before even visiting my family I had to get back to work. Because the truth of the matter is 95% of Afghans are currently not getting enough to eat, 22.8 million are facing crisis level of hunger, 97% are living below the poverty line, and 9 million are living in extreme poverty.
And these are the individuals who fought alongside us and the international `coalition` for last 20 years. They are our allies, they are our brothers and sisters and they're in desperate `straits`.
The magnitude of the work ahead is staggering. But we have to `start` somewhere. And the question becomes: what should we do? In my mind, four things.
First, we must `bolster` humanitarian `aid` provisions for the international community by increasing support for and donations to `glassroot` organiazations, that have infrastrucure to ensure that aid is getting directly into the hands of the people who need it the most. And that's just not my organization. There are so many `support-worthy` groups doing exceptional work in Afghanistan and we need resources now.
Second, we government and citizens of the 36 counteries who fought in Afghanistan must keep our promises to Afghan allies to whom we owe a dept by fast-tracking their resettlement be it in the United States or elsewhere.
This, first and `foremost`, `necessitiates` resettling refugees `who are` currently `waiting` in camps around the world, to reach a place that they can call home. It also calls upon the international community to increase `quotas` for Afghan allies to accept more `at-risk` Afghans for permanent resettlment and to expand programs like humanitarian `parole` to generate more pathways for those in need.
Third, as we find `pathways` forward for this individuals we must not separate families. We must preserve them. Or at the very least create strict limits for the amount of time that families can be separated from. Family seperation like mine generate `irrepairable` harm. But clear in specific changes to existing admission policies can ensure that other minors do not face the same fate that `befell` me and my family.
Fourth, and this is the most important of them all. We must reestablish an international diplomatic` presence` in Afghan to hold Taliban accountable for their actions and provide `consular` services to the people. It opens a channel to adress Taliban's actions rather than cutting off, isolating and eliminating avenues for influence.
And I have witnessed what engagement with the Taliban can look like firsthand. The negotiations that resulted in my release from captivity were the direct result of the effective diplomacy with the Taliban on the world stage.
Diplomats spoke to each other openly and reserved an issue of `mutual` concern. And while the success of `this` discussion is perhaps an anomaly the kind of diplomacy demonstrated by my release can `and should` serve as a model for achieving other desired change for the future of Afghanistan such as the restoration of girls' education `above grade` six, freedom of press, bolstering women's rights, and most urgently increasing humanitarian assistance.
At the same time, `our` diplomacy can't be a `blank check` the Taliban must `live` up to their end of the bargain to demonstrate that they're ready to engage in diplomacy, as an actor that upholds basic human rights that ensure necessary freedoms and that does not take or hold hostages.
At the end of the day the situation in Afghanistan is an extremely complex one. It can't be summed up in eight-minute talk I wrote 4 days ago, emerging from captivity. Yet there are tangible solution in I'm in the previleged position of being able to advocate for them but I am here today to tell you that you are too.
The truth of the matter is a specially in the case of Afghanistan change has always and `will` continute to start with everyday people. This `fall`, `tens of thousands` of `people` from around world banded together at the glassroots level to aid Afghans in need. You don't need to be an expert to engage to volunteer, to contribute, to lobby, or to even simply welcome a refugee to advocate for them.
As `Margaret Mead` once said: Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world. Indeed it is the only thing that ever has. On the afternoon of my release 10 days ago, I, at long last, climbed out of the basement cell. And into the sunlight without anything binding my hand or covering my eyes. I could see the sky.
I traveled out of the prison through Kabul city in a `Corolla sedan` I passed the American `embassy` and arrived at Kabul international airport. I walked onto the tarmac, I climbed into the C-17, I shook hands with American `Quatari` and British diplomats, and `suddenly` I was a free man again.
But again, I was one of the lucky ones. Ultimately being a captive reminded me of a time when I was helpless, and needed a voice. Now that I'm released I have my voice back and mercifully it puts me in a position where I can advocate for that little boy with the Statue of Liberty patch on his UNHCR-donated jeans, chasing the American dream. I hope you'll join me.
