## [TED Dictation 007] THE TRICK TO REGAINING YOUR CHILDLIKE WONDER

Zach King

Sep 16, 2022

`Our` first speaker was supposed to be the amazing creative filmmaker `from LA` Zach King. But unfortunately he's gone missing. We've been trying to track him down.
(Ringing)
Ah! Hey I'm so sorry. I'm not at the conference I'm not gonna make it, `I'm stuck at the airport.` They `wouldn't let` me in `with` this, `apparently, it's` oversized. But, wait, you're `onstage`! Hold on, I've got an Idea.
`If` I `just` set the phone down here... Okay this `might`... Woo-ho! Hey! Sorry, I'm late!
People of TED, Zach King!
I'm glad that work`ed` because sometimes `I get` stuck `in` the screen and it becomes `a` whole thing.
I have a question for you this morning. What is this? A box. Yeah I ask lot of people `that` question and most people say it is `a` box. But I`'ve` met a small group of people who've told me that this is not a box. And what is fascinating about this group of people is they're the ones that `have pioneered` space travel, explore`d` the depth of oceans, and create`d some of the` most inpenetrable fortresses all before the age five.
Of course, I'm talking about my kids. See, when I showed them this, they told me that this was not a box. But rather a rocket ship, a submarine and a castle, all at once, somehow combined. So, why is it? That you and I as adults, we look at something like this we just call what it is? A box. But our children, they can see it for more possibilities.
Over the past decades as filmmaker I've been on a quest to see with this childlike wonder again. So now when I see something like such as pool table, I see entirely different type of pool. And I no longer see a little soccer ball here, It's actually got some life to it, it is little dalmatian puppy.
I no longer see the glasses half-empty. In fact, I don't even see a glass at all for me. It's actually a tasty piece of chocolate cake. See, you and I can still access the childlike wonder. We can still see in dream with this wonder. Although may have been a while since we've experienced it. So, today what I wanted do for you is have you regain your sense of childlike wonder. I will show you how to do that.
So if you will, I will tell you a story and, I invite you to imagine with me. That one christmas a box like this is wrapped and placed under a tree. And an excited little boy comes running down the stairs on christmas morning and he unwraps the box and inside is a bike.
And although he rides the bike for a few moments around the room he ends up playing with the box instead. Because to him, it is a deep dark cave. Hello! And at the bottom of the cave, is a x marks spotted.
And of course, he's the best pirate on the seas, so he's gonna dig the very treasure, so lot of work digging the treasure. And now what he has discovered? That he uh!!! oh and he was not the first pirate to look for this treasure.
But that boy had many adventures with this box over the years. Once it was his time machine, that took him to the age of dinosaurs. Another time, it was actually his bunker to hide from the zombie apocalypse. In once he even dreamed that it was his submarine that took him to the depth of the ocean. Intrical no longer holds his threats.
But one day the boy couldn't find the box. He looked in his room, he strokes his backyard. And he found it in the garage. When he ran to go play with it, he opened it up and inside were winter jacket.
And this was the day when the boy learned with the boxes were actually made to do. To store things. Now the box is just a regular box, the boy ended up packing up his things to go to college in that box. Couple of years later, soon after that, he uses that boxes to move to his first home when he got married.
And that after that to make room for the baby, he packs his film gears in this box, place on the top shelf of his garage where several while clocking dust.
See I was that boy and, I'm embarrased to admit that the boxes on the top shelf of the garage for many more years after that not being dreamed with. So one night I heard a sound. It was coming from the garage and I thought someone has breaked in so I wanted to check it out.
To my surprise, the boxes were on the ground and my kids were dreaming with the box. And they said "Daddy! We are playing rocket ship. Come play with us!" It had been a while since I played with the box but I fired the on the engine foam, sure enough, Chalrie's ear still around, and we headed to the space. Houston, we're ready to lift up.
We ended up going just a little past Jupyter, where we met some friendly space aliens, who taught us a really cool sport that I wanna show you, called space soccer. It's a really slow sports, requires a lot yoga. But it is more fun than golf.
So, it was there in that garage that I learned the key to why our kids give childlike wonder. It's because they don't have assumptions. They don't have assumptions about the box yet. They've been told what it supposed to do or what it supposed to be used for. Therefore they have all these other possibilities.
So for you and I, as we approach life and try to solve new problems, if we're labeled to move our assumptions for a moment, we can see with this new childlike wonder once again. So I wanna test the sounds at this  with this expeience, regain the little sense of your wonder.
So measure my desktop image, on the screen, and I want you to hold back your assumptions. So, on the desktop screen you might have a few assumptions you can hold back, like some you I'm really disorganized I got to many projects going on both of those are true.
But I want us to look a little deeper to see the possibility, so let me help clear the way here. I was actually looking at the background! You guys need a vacation, you know? It's actually super nice here.
I will take that..
So, the next time somebody tells you. That doesn't make sense.. Okay, I can figure this out. Maybe it's a portal! Think outside the box, you can say, "Hey, this is not a box!"
So remove our assumptions, label to then see with this childlike sense of wonder. And that's the moment when new ideas can enter the world.


## [TED Dictation 008] HOW DANCE CAN UNLEASH YOUR INNER JOY 

Ryan Heffington

Sep 23, 2022

What is your connection to dance? Do you love the ballet? Or maybe you watch dance competition in television? Or did you jump into the hora at the Bar Mitzvah one time.
I want you to reconsider your connection to dance. Because I believe to be a simple and successful way of accessing happiness within, what we need to participate virtually nothing. But your will to explore an have a little bit of with fun no music no partner required.
In a choreographer film, television or commercials, I often generated moves that are based on the human experience. I take these moves and trim them together, twist them play with piece in order to create more meaningful work, let me show what I mean. Here's a music video "Chandlier", where a choreographer Sia featuring the incredible dancer Maddy Zigler.
Now let's play the video one more time. I wanna show you what inspired those moves. You may be suprised by how elementary the resources are. And poke-poke-poke-stab in the wall-toxic el pasal come to and look charlie chaffline charlie chaffline cockoroach up wall clean your mustache after some think, it's the time for lunch yeah.
See, even a cute little cockroach inspire dance move. But it really isn't that easy. And look most people can dance like Maddi including myself. And that's the point. We all have our own beautiful ways of moving and this is worth celebrating.
It's time to extract the judgement how the dance experience and set free pre-conceived notion what good dance is. And instead, find out how your own body loves the move, and find out that inner rythme that feel so good.
Think more body less critique. So you may ask well how do I access or unlock this dance magic. Well, once you have the perspective that "Life is dance", yeah, to begin to see dance everywhere around you all day long like I do, like now.
Witness how you are sitting in front of me. Your posture, grounded one leg crossed over the other.. where your hands placed, or envision a parent locking a child. It's a playful a flush right? Tying a shoe, a grand gesture, drinking glass of water, a stylized head release.
So check out this proof-of-concept. In the first week of world by lockdown on 22 March, I decided to teach online follow long dance class called slepfest, as I hoped a couple of friend to join in, but over the course in next couple of weeks a tens of thousands of people from all over the world joined slepfest. Turning our club of isolation into a worldwide community. It was absolutely beautiful. People ? critical minds and really unleashed that joy from within doing guppy dance moves, what a worlds in this array. Take a look.
(Video playing)
Who even guessed that moves like that pretty pony or Bob loss would be so life changing. So I've been a student of dance for fourty-two years, my relationship with art run deep and quite intimate.
This helped me cure trauma, it is paid my rent, the most of us unfaultrying joy in my life. And that's why I'm here. Because I believe there's more joy for you, only steps away, this simple and rudimentry moves that you already know.
So I love to invite you to be your own choreographer, grab you kids or go solo and let fun and laughter push the boundaries of ridiculousness. Who knows? Maybe brushing your teeth or your mac-and-cheese would become your favorite dancing moves.
I want you have a dance move or two or three or four under your belt, respectfully call yourself as dancer, because you bounded it, and share those moves and happiness with those who around you, because world with more dance is the world with more joy.
(Dance performance starts)
Sit down and begin playing.
Be feel good about yourself in the world.
It will show you painting and the all little things we have.
(Dance performance ends)
Thank you!

## [TED Dictation 009] THE SHIFT WE NEED TO STOP MASS SURVEILLANCE

Albert Fox Chan

Sep 21, 2022

We all know we're all tracked everywhere we go. But as a lawyer, a technologist, and anti-surveillance activitst, I'm here to tell you two things: the threat is way worse than you realize, and the solution is simpler than you think. And know, it's not wearing a tin-foil hat.
You may know that advertizers can record every link you click and every place you've been, but you may not realize that the government can buy that data too. If the NYPD wants to track a Wilhelm protest, they can buy the data. If Texas wants to watch an Boston clinic they can buy the data. And when I arrest once to know if your florida company is really doing work in cali, they only need to buy the data. They already did - millions of our location records.
And what the government can't buy it can take by force, crudly wielding our 18th-century counstitution against 21st-century technology. With the Geofence warrant, companies are forced to hand over our location data, not for one person but everyone, every single user in a geographic area, whether a single room or entire city.
In one virginia case police casted digital dragnet far beyond the crime scene, forcing google to identify everyone nearby. Even those at a church, even though they won't even suspects, it's not only our wellian it's bad police thing.
Such widely enough and someone's movements were always looks suspicous. Like an arizona man, wrongly arrested for murder miles away simply because someone was logged into his google account, or florida man connected to a crime scene for biking around the neighborhood.
I all know about you but I find it hard enough to woke up the energy to work out, wihtout worrying that my fifth this is landing in jail. Technology makes tracking possible but it's our loss if give it force posing a deeply discriminatory danger to buy park communities LGBTQ individuals, and undocumented families.
We can continue to watch officer shred the force to man-manth safe guard against such an seizure we can't wait for the springcourt act we must ban geofence warrants and other surveillances abuses today.
For years privacy advocates have fought our companies collecting our data and we failed maybe we should try the tin foil hats after all. But we can stop mass surveillance if we change the probelm we're trying to fix - shifting our focus from how companies collect the data to how governments abuse it.
In America our ? rulers that every smartphone computer and internet or even toaster oven is a police tool on the make it. Officers can seize our devices and wire tap Alexa but they don't control the contours of our constitution. It's our decision, our democratic decision, whether our data can be used for undemocratic ends.
We can create new firewalls to protect our information not computer code but legal code that shield us from having our data used against us in a code of law. Legal firewalls are already became a reality in NY. At the pandemic sight we feared police and eyes might mass use the data from new contact tracing app that monitor everyone nearby.
So we want to work with doctors glassroot organizers to create the first ban on police access to contact tracing data in the country. No one should fear that they'll be arrested because of public health data but that means a risk in 49 states.
Legal firewalls let us have our technology and our consitiution too in neighboring innovation by outlying impression. We see glymose of the way by partisonship but state them local governements our brightest hope. That's because it takes millions of people. To interact international statue but a handful of comitted activists can't make changes in their communities.
And we already see a del use of state of local protection. Including a bill I helped right NY's first nation ban an geofence warrants. Thank you.
And event some courts agree. Just last month a federal judge struck down that sprolling virginia geofence calling all state lawmakers to an act bills like my own as a teenage protester NYPD camcoder sholved in my face I thought surveillance as a threat and people thought my fear's something as science fiction.
Today they increasingly think that surveillance is inevitable and that privacy is the fantasy. But I'm actually more optimistic than ever. It had to get this bad for the denial or break and the public to act.
I know we can push back that remaining distopia. I know we can't protect everything that technology might make possible tomorrow but only if we ban survelliance abuses today. Thank you.
