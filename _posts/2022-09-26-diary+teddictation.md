## [TED Dictation 010] YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD TO LIVE IN A BETTER ONE

Majora Carter

Sep 30, 2022

Successful companies don't invest in talent. So the competition can hire them away. They keep their people motivated to grow with the company. And inspire those around them to lean and with them.
I believe that talent retention, the same tool used to grow successful companies, can be used to build great neighborhoods for the people born and raised in them.
My hometown is South Bronx NYC, and it's the kind of neighborhood that some might say acutally has a talent repulsion strategy. Back in the 1980s, I walked by this crack house, on the way to the subway that would take me to my high school, one of the best in the contury in the Bronxside School of Science.
Alight, figured there'd be at least some of you in here.
Neighborhoods like mine, a place is where inequality is assumed by the people who live there and by everyone else on the outside looking in these are places where the schools, public health, air and water, parks and trees, food options, and career opportunities, are worse than other parts of the same town.
Government subsidized lental housing, and health clinics, homeless shelters, liquor stores and dollor stores predominate. A few banks, but plenty of check cashing stores or phone shops that charge you use the money you may have.
I refer to these communities as low status, I don't call them poor or underpreviliged because frankly 'status' implies something larger and deeper at work. And that inequality is a well-established fact.
Think of the communities like that near you, they're everywhere inner cities, their reservations white Rust Belt towns ond all over the worlds and bright kid who grow up in them are expected to measure successful by how far they get away from them.
I was one of those kids. And now I'm a real estate developer in strategy consultant, and I work nationally but South Bronx is my research and development laboratory where for I actually practice retroative community development.
And that same corner that once a crack house is now the home of my hip-hop cafe, award-winning hip-hop cafe, the Boogie Down Grind, and it's two blocks away from the house I grew up in and around the corner from where I live right now.
So I have embraced my inner capitalist and my inner socialist and my inner libertarians among a bunch of bunch of other things, however, but I like to talk now about how capitalism and the spirit behind it and its applications that's what determines the outcomes.
So US capitallism supported salvery and it supported black wall streets those communities of black folks formerly enslaved or just one generation out of it. And where they built great businesses and wealth and communities. And the most famous of which was the town of Greenwood in Tusla, Oklahoma.
Black wall streets were destroyed, burnt down and black people in them merdered by white mobs, savagely and without consequence. Now, was that capitalism's fault or some kind of white cultural flaw or distinction that has gone unadressed to this day?
Now I know some people don't like hear about that but imagine what it feels like to experience it. I mean, America has had a talent retention strategy or some or something like it Since 1619 slavery provided white americans with all the benefits of the that barbaric and predatory industry.
And although the black wall streets were built on the sustainable ideals of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and property ownership, black wall streets were destroyed because the people who built them were not white. Same system very different outcomes.
City group estimates that the racial wealth gap in the US has actually cost us 16 trillion dollars over the last 20 years alone.
Now let's just think about that for just a moment the money that could have gone into economy but didn't because of systemic racism that defined who benefited from america's growth.
There's no need to reinvent the wheel here. If we want to make Americal as good as it promise, then we should apply the same tools of capitalism that built white wealth, to build wealth in low-status communities.
Especially, in terms of property ownership and real estate development because real estate develoment in low-status communities in US currently takes one of two paths: first poverty maintenance wherein you see things like the concentration of things such as health clinics and government subsidising housing rental housing pharmarcies, philanthropic and govenment dollars pour in, and the non-profit industrial complexes seems to view poverty sort of as an authentic cultural attribute of the area and thus you'll see all sort of programs that are designed to sort of manage the poverty, but the communities do not imporve money will be made, lots of it, but not for the local people.
And in fact, one can view many of these well-intention programs as talent extraction, because the promsing talent isn't encouraged to grow up and be somebody but certainly not in their own hood.
And the other type is gentrification displacement. When urban populations grow even some politicions and even some activist will resist greater density. So you have rising demand and limited supply, and then prices go up.
And gentrification generally means outsiders coming in to a community in order to build one that suits their needs and their desires, but and it's not for the needs and desires of the people that already in the community, but let's just be real. It's not always mutually exclusive because people in those communities want nice things too. They do. And that is why they live whenever they can in order to experience them.
So capitalism can fuel gentrification and displacement or poverty maintenance, but neither of these strategies acutally help the people in those communities live in the kind of neighborhood that we all deserve.
What if we looked and at low-status communities as though they are struggling companies how would we turn them around? How would a talent retention model work on a neighborhood scale?
So municipalities they hand out corporate retention deals because they believe that an economic activity that it will produce is actually worth subsidy that they pay out. And so we'll need to do same thing in low-status communities for the people that were led to believe that they need measure success by how far away they get away from those places.
So we can't really force anybody to stay but we can nudge them with lifestyle infrastructure the type of stuff that we learned through our market research that people told us that they wanted. Places like cafes and bars and bookstores and farmer's market and the places that, frankly, you probably all like to go to, too.
They build positive community interactions and make people feel really cool. So another nudge would be real access to property ownership and business ownership that keeps people vested in their neighborhoods these are like benefits, you know, and company stock options.
So when the community does well, so do the residence. It's kind of like the employs of hot startup. So how do we make sure that these benefits and stock options get in the right hands and appreciate the value for them.
In the US, if you are accuesed of a crime and can't affort legal counsel, a public defender will be assigned to you. The same can be done for local property owners. Before a real estate transaction goes forward, within a low-status community, the seller should receive quality legal and financial counsel so they are fully aware of the value of their land and how they could they maximize it through sensible refinancing by building you know vertical additions for the rentals and also you know accessory dwelling units and also using the value to do sensible refinancing put their kids through college, build a business and you know maybe you know property owners might even be considered a protected class by the United States Securities and Exchange commmision, in order to protect black wealth in particular and other low-status communitiy wealth from the continuing liquidation that they still deal with because it is common for a people who do own property in low-status communities to be approached all the time for the quick cash offers these are actual solicitations that I received in my home.
They can be very enticing to people who would never been led to believe that there's any real value in their community. And the thing is, it's all legal. And real estate companities, big and small, as well as private equity have done a very effective job of increasing wealth inequality in US by separating financially unsavvy people from any hope of generational wealth potential.
So you know, the SEC recently proposed new rules requiring businesses to report their green house gas emissions in an effort to increase transparency of the risk to its investors.
Maybe they should do same thing for taxpayers. We know real estate and private equity firms can engage in predatory practices at the expenses of taxpayers by privitising the profits and sociallizing the costs.
And this is because the business model that reduces opportunities for home ownership also creates more landless renters exacervates the concentration of poverty. And statistically increases poverty ill effects including higher rates of bad policing and incarceration and lower health and educational outcomes.
Their message shut out aspiring home owners from the American Dream. It comes at a cost to all of us. And so it should come at a far greater costs to those who do business like that.
Another issue is that some renters actually pay more in rent, than they would on mortgage but most of us who actually needs a mortgage, cannot compete with the speed at which predatory specualtors show up with all cash deals, period.
A possible solution is for philanthropic organizations to buy properties at market value from those who actually choose once they're fully aware of what they're selling who choose the people who choose themselves, and then hold them so that other folks within the communities to have time to get financing and buy that's a valuable cushion of time for people and it gives people a change to participate in American Dream.
And it's a low risk place to park capital. These are some examples of just how we can build a restorative economic approach to capitalism. It's still capitalism but with rules and practices that favor the outcomes that we need as nation.
But folks on the ground they are not waiting. They're absolutely not waiting. In West Oakland, California, third-generation West Oaklandier Noni Session leads the East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative. They have recently acquired property collectively to build a permanent affordable a mixed-use real estate development that benefits its resident owners.
The cooperatives offers these lunchtime learning sessions so people can fully understand things about investment and develoment and their current membership includes about 500 community investor, resident and staff owners. And they have today raised 5 million dollars for their community, landing and housing fund.
And in Philadelphia, a community development program called JumpStart started by Kermn Weinstein he is a commercial real estate developer, and the program provides a training, mentoring, and loans to aspring local residential developers, mostly women and people of color.
Since 2015, they trained more than 2500 people, more and 350 loans totalling more than 40 million dollars that have actually rehabbed more than 350 units totally rehabilitated.
Their respective activities actually improved the value of each others' properties and they are reducing blight in Philly neighborhood by neighborhood from the inside out.
JumpStart's now in more than 13 conturies around the country. And Dune Lankard is a member of the Eyak Trib in Alaska, and what he's working on is securing livelihoods for aspiring Native youth and woman, you know, where he's from.
And he's doing it through kelp farming in ancestal native waters. Kelp is traditional food source No. 1 and it also has imporant commercial components in bioplastics and pharmaceuticals, and also they use it as an additive in cow feed to reduce the methane in it I mean it is amazing what it could do, but what he is competing aginst is multi-national companies to actually own a piece of this emerging ocean industry for his people so he's gonna be up against but he's got to be doing this it's so important.
And in south bronx, there's this histroic rail station, that brought my daddy who was Pullman porter, into the neighborhood where I was born and raised, back in the 1940s, it was even harder to get a mortgage while Black and he won 15,000 dollars in a horse race and carried it into a satchel you know back across the contury and purchased a home near that rail station for his family
And that rail station, has recently been acquired by his baby daughter, be me, transforming it into a mixed- multi-use for performance venue, event hall for music and weddings and quinceanears and gaming tournaments and I..
I am the manifestation of my mommy and daddy's wildest dreams
Now I'm not saying that talent retention is gonna solve all the problems associated, with poverty maintenance, or displacement and gentrification or solve all the wrongs of capitalism but I know we're not gonna solve any of those problems without it we don't have to keep building monuments that honor the shameful practices that crated ineqality that low-status communities experience
If we use the tools of capitalism we have, but in a much more restorative way, we can help people in low-status communities show that you don't have out of our neighborhoods to live in better ones. Thank you.
