## Using mathjax to include mathematical expressions (3):

Exercise 3.5.16

Suppose that a increasing function $f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is defined on $X\subset\mathbb{R}$.  Show that if $f(X)$ is connected, $f$ is continuous.

$Proof.$

Proof is done by contradiction.

Let me assume that $f(X)$ is connected but $f$ is not continuous.  Then for some $x_0\in\mathbb{R}$, below holds:

$\forall\delta\gt 0$, $\exists x\in X$ and $\epsilon\gt 0$ such that $\left\lvert x-x_0 \right\rvert \lt\delta$ and $\left\lvert f(x)-f(x_0) \right\rvert \gt\epsilon$

As $f$ is increasing, if we set $U = X\cap\left(-\infty,x_0\right]$ and $V = X\cap\left[x_0+\delta,\infty\right)$,

$f(U) \cap f(V) = \emptyset$ and $f(U) \cup f(V) = f(X)$ holds.

This means that $f(U)$ and $f(V)$ comprise a separation in $f(X)$ and therefore $f(X)$ is not connected.
