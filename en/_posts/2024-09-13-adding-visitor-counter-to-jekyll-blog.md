excerpt: How to add a custom visitor counter to your jekyll-based github blog using an open-source web analytics **GoatCounter**.
---
There is no simple way to add a visitor counter to your personal blog if you are hosting yours using a static web-site generator like `Jekyll`.  Fortunately, there is an open-source web analytics platform [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/), developed and being maintained by [Martin Tournoij](https://github.com/arp242), which you can use to implement visitor counter display.

In this posting I would like to explain how I added a visitor counter to my github blog using GoatCounter.  My blog is based on a Jekyll theme **Minimal Mistakes**, for your information.  You can try to add your custom visitor counter as I did, or use a theme like [Satelliteüõ∞Ô∏è](https://byanko55.github.io/) which already implemented post-wise pageview counter using GoatCounter.

## Creating GoatCounter Account

First of all, you need to create your new GoatCounter account.  Visit the [website](https://www.goatcounter.com/) and click **‚òû Sign Up** button.

Complete your sigining-up by filling required fields up.

After signing up and logging in, you can see the visitor statistics of your website.  In above case you need to access to `my-code.goatcounter.com` to log in.  Statistics dashboard is like below image, which you can see similar after enough visitor count data is built up.

## Creating Visitor Counter

Now let's make our oun visitor counter feature.  [Official documentation](https://goatcounter.com/help/visitor-counter) is well maintained, where you can find there are two ways you can approach to implement visitor counter.  You can use a preset from the developer or directly access to JSON objects and use it to get visitor count numbers.

### Using Preset

You decide to use preset visitor counter (see below image to see how it looks like).  I believe that most of you would prefer to implement your own visitor counter blending better with your blogs/sites rather than using preset.  So I would like to skip the details of how to use this preset visitor counter.

![Í∏∞Î≥∏ Î∞©Î¨∏Ïûê Ïπ¥Ïö¥ÌÑ∞](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=10ajeKN8SG_hrGqVw0YJL9HO4uEadwXoN&sz=w400)

### Direct Access to Visitor Counts

You can make a direct access to the visitor count numbers of individual pages.  There are JSON files you can access.  For example, if your website domain is `https://my-code.github.io`, visitor count value of individual URLs are updated to below JSON file every 30 minutes:

```
https://my-code.goatcounter.com/counter/URL.json
```

Let me give you some example:

```
<!-- URL of target page -->
https://my-code.github.io/example

<!-- JSON file where visitor count is updated -->
https://my-code.goatcounter.com/counter/example.json
```

There are some special cases.  By 'special cases' I mean 1) visitor count for home page (index.html) and 2) visitor count for your whole site (total visitors).

```
<!-- Home Page (index.html) -->
https://my-code.goatcounter.com/counter//.json

<!-- Total Visitors -->
https://my-code.goatcounter.com/counter/TOTAL.json
```

You can use `start`, `end` keywords to query visitor counts within specified range of dates.  Both keys accept date input in `yyyy-mm-dd` format.  Furthermore, you can also pass specific values like `week`, `month`, `year` to `start` key.

Below you can find some examples where you can get the JSON data where the total visitor counts (remind that the page name `TOTAL` is reserved for site-total visitor count number) are being queried with different span of time.  `TOTAL` can be replaced with any proper permalink of pages in your site to get the pageview of individual pages.
 
```
<!-- Last week -->
https://my-code.goatcounter.com/counter/TOTAL.json?start=week

<!-- Last month -->
https://my-code.goatcounter.com/counter/TOTAL.json?start=month

<!-- Last year -->
https://my-code.goatcounter.com/counter/TOTAL.json?start=year

<!-- Specific date range -->
https://my-code.goatcounter.com/counter/TOTAL.json?start=2024-03-01&end=2024-06-01
```
{: file="passing queries"}

When you access the JSON file, there are two keys of `count` and `count_unique` whose values are both same.  `count_uniuqe` is a legacy key and therefore only the `count` key is used.

### Apply to the Website

Now let's move on to the application of above JSON raw data to embody the visitor counter in our website.  As already mentioned, I created visitor counter for my blog built on the Jekyll theme **Minimal Mistakes**.

First of all, below code was added to my custom header file `custom.html`.

```html
<script data-goatcounter="https://my-code.goatcounter.com/count" async src="//gc.zgo.at/count.js"></script>
<script>
    var t = setInterval(function() {
        if (window.goatcounter && window.goatcounter.visit_count) {
            clearInterval(t)
            var now = new Date();
            var todayUTC = new Date(Date.UTC(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), now.getDate()));
            var daily = new XMLHttpRequest();
            daily.addEventListener('load', function() {
                document.querySelector('#gc_daily').innerText = JSON.parse(this.responseText).count.replace(/\s/g, "");
            })
            daily.open('GET', 'https://my-code.goatcounter.com/counter/TOTAL.json?start=' + todayUTC.toISOString().slice(0, 10))
            daily.send()
            var total = new XMLHttpRequest();
            total.addEventListener('load', function() {
                document.querySelector('#gc_total').innerText = JSON.parse(this.responseText).count.replace(/\s/g, "");
            })
            total.open('GET', 'https://my-code.goatcounter.com/counter/TOTAL.json')
            total.send()
        }
    })
</script>
```
{: file="_includes/head/custom.html"}

Some remarks:
- `setInterval()` is used to prevent JSON file being called before the source js file `//gc.zgo.at/count.js` being loaded.  Visitor counter number is not properly updated when a page is refreshed, if we do not give some interval between the loading of `count.js` file and querying JSON data.
- There is no way to query daily visitor count but specific date needs to be passed (there is no query parameter for this like `?start=day`).  So `Date()`, `Date.UTC()`, and `toISOString()` was used to create `yyyy-mm-dd` formatted current date considering the client system's time zone.
- Today visitor count and total visitor count were set to be replaced into the text element with predefined IDs - `gc_daily` and `gc_total`.  So I had to add actual html elements which have these IDs.  In my case I added `<span>` elements with these IDs at the end of sidebar.

`_includes/nav_list` file was modified to have `<span>` elements having proper IDs:

```html
{% assign navigation = site.data.navigation[include.nav] %}
{% include multilang/get-lang-variables %}
<nav class="nav__list">
  {% if page.sidebar.title %}<h3 class="nav__title" style="padding-left: 0;">{{ page.sidebar.title }}</h3>{% endif %}
  <input id="ac-toc" name="accordion-toc" type="checkbox" />
  <label for="ac-toc">{{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].menu_label | default: "Toggle Menu" }}</label>
  <ul class="nav__items">
    {% for nav in navigation %}
      <li>
        {% if nav.url %}
          <a href="{{ nav.url | prepend: prefix | relative_url }}"><span class="nav__sub-title">{{ nav.title }}</span></a>
        {% else %}
          <span class="nav__sub-title">{{ nav.title }}</span>
        {% endif %}

        {% if nav.children != null %}
        <ul>
          {% for child in nav.children %}
            <li><a href="{{ child.url | prepend: prefix | prepend: site.url }}"{% if child.url == page.url %} class="active"{% endif %}>{{ child.title }}</a></li>
          {% endfor %}
        </ul>
        {% endif %}
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
    <!-- Visitor counter starts -->
      <li>
        <span class="nav__sub-title"></span>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Today </b><span id="gc_daily"></span> | <b>Total </b><span id="gc_total"></span></li>
        <ul>
      </li>
    <!-- Visitor counter ends -->
  </ul>
</nav>
```
