## Introduction

Prediction of long-term cycle life is one of the most challenging tasks in the battery technology where machine learning approaches have been arguing their usefulness quite rapidly.

Since the work of Severson et. al. in 2019, where the scientists leveraged data-driven machine learning technique (Elasticnet regression model) to provide accurate prediction on the Lithium ion batteries' long-term cycle lives only with the early stage (less than 100 cycles) of charging/discharging cycling test[^1], there have been significant contributions from academic communities to build better-performing machine learning frameworks. This post aims to provide reviews on some of those contributions came to my attention.
